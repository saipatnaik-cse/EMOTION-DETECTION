# **EMOTION-DETECTION**
## ABSTRACT
Human emotion recognition plays important role in the social relationship. Emotions are reflected from verbalization, hand, gestures of a body, through outward appearances and facial expressions. The purpose is to present strategy dependent on facial recognition to identify student's comprehension of the entire distant learning process. Emotion recognition model comprises of three phases, Feature extraction, Subset feature and Emotion classifier. A Haar Cascades technique is utilized to identify the input image, a face, as a reason for the extraction of eyes and mouth, and afterwards through the sobel edge detection to get the characteristic value. Through training neural network classifier, five various kinds of emotion classifications are obtained. The emotion recognition based on the facial expression is feasible on the distance education, allowing recognizable proof as an student's learning status continuously in real time. Therefore, it can assist the teachers to change the strategy of teaching according to the student's emotions.

Facial expression conveys non-verbal cues, which plays an important roles in interpersonal relations. The Facial Expression Recognition System is the process of identifying the emotional state of a person. In this system captured image is compared with the trained dataset available in database and then emotional state of the image will be displayed.

Significantly, these emotions are exhibited through facial expressions that are consistently correspondent. This means that regardless of language and cultural barriers, there will always be a set of fundamental facial expressions that people assess and communicate with. After extensive research, it is now generally agreed that humans share five facial expressions that reflect the experiencing of fundamental emotions. These fundamental emotions are happiness, sadness, surprise, anger, and neutral. Unless a person actively suppresses their expressions, examining a person‟s face can be one method of effectively discerning their genuine mood and reactions.

## INTRODUCTION
A facial expression is a gesture executed with the facial muscles, which convey the emotional state of the subject to observers. That similarity implies about the facial expression most important role-being a channel of nonverbal communication. Facial expressions are a primary means of conveying nonverbal information among humans, though many animal species display facial expressions too. Human emotions that can be displayed by the face can be categorized into five basic expressions, which are referred to as happiness, sadness, surprise, anger, and neutral. The image processing techniques highly relevant for identifying facial features under uneven lighting and interpreting the face emotion through the processed facial features. To improve accuracy, more photos are required, increasing computation time. On the other hand, in pursuit of efficiency, we would reduce the accuracy which means collection less feature data. Experimental results from current solutions show that in some cases accuracy is higher, but time spent is also high. To find the best solution for emotion recognition in learning virtual environment, both accuracy and efficiency needs to be achieved. Optimization of recognition of emotional changes in the facial features of online learners, will allow teachers to adjust teaching strategies and methods, give real-time feedback to students, and achieve the best teaching quality.

## PURPOSE
1. To develop a facial expression recognition system.
2. To experiment machine learning algorithm in computer vision field.
3. To detect emotion thus facilitating Intelligent Human-Computer Interaction.

## PROJECT SCOPE

The scope of this system is to tackle with the problems that can arise in day to day life. Some of the scopes are:
1. The system can be used to detect and track a user‟s state of mind.
2. The system can be used in mini-marts, shopping center to view the feedback of the customers to enhance the business,
3. The system can be installed at busy places like airport, railway station or bus station for detecting human faces and facial expressions of each person. If there are any faces that appeared suspicious like angry or fearful, the system might set an internal alarm.
4. The system can also be used for educational purpose such as one can get feedback on how the student is reacting during the class.
5. This system can be used for lie detection amongst criminal suspects during interrogation
6. This system can help people in emotion related -research to improve the processing of emotion data.
7. Clever marketing is feasible using emotional knowledge of a person which can be identified by this system.

## PROJECT FEATURES

The system classifies facial expression of the same person into the basic emotions namely anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise. The main purpose of this system is efficient interaction between human beings and machines using eye gaze, facial expressions, cognitive modelling etc. Here, detection and classification of facial expressions can be used as a natural way for the interaction between man and machine. And the system intensity vary from person to person and also varies along with age, gender, size and shape of face, and further, even the expressions of the same person do not remain constant with time.
